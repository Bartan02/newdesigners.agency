						Customers come to us with design issues that we
						translate into suitable solutions, such as complete
						style guides, websites and apps. New Designers members
						mainly work for external clients from the business
						world, but also do design work for THUAS lectorates and
						other educational initiatives. Students work in
						multidisciplinary teams when realising projects. Our
						goal is to have every design built and put live, so that
						the end product will be used IRL. Do you want to
						collaborate or have a design question waiting to be
						answered?

						investment rounds. Have a great idea? Please send us an
