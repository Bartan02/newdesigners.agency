# New Designers Developer Assignment

Hello and welcome to the New Designers team! Your test assignment is to create a new project page template from the design we've prepared for our agency website. This task will involve creating a new markdown file and implementing the structure of the new template page. Please keep track of your time and make sure to send this in your final email.

This project uses Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. You won't need to worry about the header and footer as those are already present. Your focus will be on the project page content.

## Task Details

You will be using the design mockup available on our Figma: 

[Design Mockup](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1239137924714718142)

Take a good look at the design and familiarize yourself with it. You will be recreating this design within our Vue.js and Tailwind CSS environment.

## Resources

You will find our project on GitHub:

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/newdesigners/newdesigners.agency/tree/assignment)

Inside this repository, you'll find a markdown file at `content/projects/test-project.md`. This file will give you an idea of how we use markdown files to populate our templates.

## Your Assignment

1. Fork the existing repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new markdown file `newTemplateProject.md` based on the `test-project.md`. This markdown file will be used to populate the new project page template.
3. Implement the structure of the new template page based on the design in the `newTemplateProject.md` file. You will be translating the Figma design into Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.
4. Test your work thoroughly. Make sure your template properly renders the content from the markdown file and matches the design mockup.

## Deliverables

After you have completed the task, follow these steps:

1. Deploy your forked repository on Netlify.
2. Provide us with the URL of your forked GitHub repository and your Netlify deployment by sending an email to Siddhart Ghogli at 21067392@student.hhs.nl. Please CC t.i.vandenbosch@hhs.nl and l.pavlova@hhs.nl on this email.

Remember, we're looking for your ability to create clean, maintainable code and your eye for detail in translating design to a live webpage.

Good luck! We're excited to see what you come up with!
